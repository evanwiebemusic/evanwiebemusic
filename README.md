# Hi, I'm Evan�

I'm passionate about voice, audio, and audio storytelling. Currently exploring the intersection of voice technology and human expression.

## What I'm interested in
- Voice AI and synthesis
- Audio quality and curation
- The art of voice casting and direction
- Ethical approaches to voice cloning

## Why ElevenLabs?
I love how ElevenLabs is already becoming a household name, and has the gold standard of TTS interfaces.

## Background
Trained in music, composition, and audio engineering, I've helped thousands of Voice actors improve their performances and their home studio audio.
